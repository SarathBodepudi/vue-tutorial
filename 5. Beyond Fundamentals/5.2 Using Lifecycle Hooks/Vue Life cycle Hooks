Vue Lifecycle allows us to run code at certain points in the application life cycle.

Vue goes through a process called the life cycle - which enables us to run the code when a new instance is created.
We are not limited to creating the data inside our instance.

We can run code during the creation process and even after the instance is destroyed.

Before the Vue life cycle may begin, the instance has to be created using the Vue createApp function

LifeCycle Steps:


1. Vue.createApp().mount()
    --> Lifecycle hook: beforeCreate
2. Initialize data and methods
3. Instance Create. --> Lifecycle hook: created
4. Compile Template (el Property)
5. Replace el Property with compiled Template
    --> Lifecycle hook: beforeMount
6. --> Lifecycle hook: Mounted
7. Once mounted, application will watch for data changes
    --> Lifecycle hook: beforeUpdate
8. Applies any changes
    --> Lifecycle hook: updated
9. Go to step 0. Mounts. Cycle repeats
10. Unmount
    --> Lifecycle hook: beforeUnmount
11. Vue Instance destroyed
12. --> Lifecycle hook: unmounted
