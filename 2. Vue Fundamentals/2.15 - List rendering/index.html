      Sometimes, you want to grab the index in the loop.
      If we are solely interested in value, we can just provide the alias for the value. Ex: bird.
      However, if we want to grab the value and the index of the value, we will need to wrap this part of the
      expression with parenthesis.

      Vuw requires we provide an alias for the name and index. 
      We can call the 'index' whatever we want. It is a common practice to call it 'index'

      <li v-for="(bird, index) in birds" :class="bird" :key="bird"> 
        {{ bird }}  - {{index}}

    <!-- 
      What is we have several properties, like age and name above, to display?
      Having to type each property name is time consuming.
      v-for directive is capable of looping through the object as well.
