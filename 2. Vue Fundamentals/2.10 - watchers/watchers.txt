So far, we have seen data methods and computed objects in the Vue instance. 
There is one more property that allows you to manipulate data which are called watchers.

Watchers watch your data for changes.
whenever a change occurs, you can run a function to execute additional logic.
In a sense, it's way to hook into process of when a value is updated.
